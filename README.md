Introduction:
    This is my first project being hosted in github. This project will focus on HTML, its tags and attributes of the elements of HTML.

Skills I have learnt:
    After completing this project, I will have learnt basic HTML elements and their attributes and other things like image formats, prevention against phising by adding 'rel' attribute with value of 'noopener noreferrer', etc.
